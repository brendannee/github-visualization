#Hacker School Github Visualzation

I wanted to know what other [Hacker Schoolers](http://hackerschool.com) were working on, what languages they were using and a fast way to browse their projects. I created the [Hacker School Project Visualization](http://hs.bn.ee) to answer these questions. [D3](http://d3js.org) was used for the visualization.

If you are a Hacker Schoolet and your github account isn't showing up, just fork this project, add yourself to lib/users.js and do a pull request.  Pull requests are welcome for other improvements and visualizations.

## Example
